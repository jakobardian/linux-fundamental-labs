# Modul 2 - Linux Service Management

## Overview

In this module, I configured and managed Linux services using **systemd**. 
The module documents hands-on tasks including service control, troubleshooting, 
and real-world server scenarios.

## Objectives

By completing this module, I am able to:
- List, check, start, stop, restart services
- Enable/disable services at boot
- Install & configure Nginx
- Manage unit files and dependencies
- Troubleshoot failed services & restart loops
- Analyze logs
- Cleanup service configs

## Learning Scopes 

This module includes:
- Systemd basics & service concepts
- Service lifecycle management
- Boot behavior control
- Nginx setup as service
- Unit file & dependency handling
- Troubleshooting & log analysis
- Cleanup configurations

```

## Hands-on Practice

I performed all hands-on activities in `practice.md`, 
following step-by-step commands to simulate real 
service management tasks on a Linux system.

## Incident Simulation

I simulated service-related incidents in `incident.md`, 
including service failures, log analysis, 
root cause identification, and recovery validation.
