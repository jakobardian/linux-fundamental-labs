# Module 5: Linux Network Management

## Overview
This module focuses on inspecting, managing, and troubleshooting 
Linux network configuration using practical, command-line–based 
workflows commonly used in system administration and cloud environments.

## Learning Objectives
After completing this module, I am able to:
- Understand IP addressing, gateway, and DNS behavior
- Inspect network interfaces and routing tables
- Diagnose connectivity and DNS resolution issues
- Identify open ports and map them to running services
- Manage and verify basic firewall rules
- Simulate, recover from, and clean up network misconfigurations

## Scope of Practice
- Network inspection and diagnostics
- Connectivity and service exposure troubleshooting
- Firewall configuration and verification
- Failure simulation and recovery

## Module Structure
This module is organized into the following sub-modules:
1. Understanding IP Addressing, Gateway, and DNS
2. Inspecting Network Interfaces
3. Inspecting Routing Table
4. Testing Network Connectivity
5. Diagnosing DNS Resolution Issues
6. Tracing Network Paths
7. Inspecting Open Ports and Sockets
8. Mapping Ports to Running Services
9. Identifying Listening and Established Connections
10. Troubleshooting Network Connectivity Issues
11. Basic Firewall Configuration (UFW)
12. Verifying Firewall Rules
13. Simulating Network Misconfiguration
14. Validating Network Recovery
15. Capturing Network Evidence
16. Cleaning Up Network Configuration

## Hands-on Files
- `PRACTICE.md` – Step-by-step commands and hands-on exercises
- `INCIDENT.md` – Simulated network incidents and troubleshooting notes
- `screenshots/` – Evidence and validation screenshots 

## Environment
- Linux distro: Ubuntu Dekstop ver.24.04
- Platform: Virtual Machine VMware Workstation ver.25H2
- Shell: Zsh

## How This Module Is Used
1. Execute commands and exercises in practice.md
2. Simulate failures and document findings in incident.md
3. Validate recovery steps and system state
4. Capture screenshots as supporting evidence

## Learning Outcome
Able to manage and troubleshoot Linux network configuration, diagnose connectivity 
and service exposure issues, and perform structured network incident handling 
on Linux servers and cloud virtual machines.
